# Ec1152_sections </br>
Harvard University - Spring 2019 </br>
Instructor: Prof. Raj Chetty </br>
Head TF: Greg Bruich </br>
TF: Diana Goldemberg </br>

IMPORTANT:
This repo had all sections notebooks and slides. However, after the class ended, I only kept public one sample section (week 3, about Regression Discontinuity).
