# EC1152 - Using Big Data to Solve Economic and Social Problems</br>
Harvard University - Spring 2019  |  Instructor: Prof. Raj Chetty </br>
Head TF: Greg Bruich  |  TF: Diana Goldemberg </br>

Being a Teaching Fellow for this class was one of the highlights of my experience at Harvard!

This repo used to contain all the Jupyter notebooks I created for my sections and the slides I used (which were a joint effort from multiple TFs). 
After the class ended, I only kept public one sample section (week 3, about Regression Discontinuity).

However, all the video recordings and slides from Prof. Chetty are available (here)[https://opportunityinsights.org/course/]
